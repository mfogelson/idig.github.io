The axisymmetric problem is solved through a Newton-Raphson technique on discretized nonlinear shell equations. Comparison of computed load-deflection curves to experimental data from both thick and thin shells generally shows good agreement in peak loads and the type of instability. For a point load, the load increases monotonically with deflection; as the ring radius increases, transition-type (snap-through) and then local buckling occurs. In addition, the pre- and post-buckled mechanical behaviors of the shell are examined.},

We quantify the impact the precision of a part characteristic has on the overall quality of a product by using a standard Taguchi loss function. Part manufacturing cost is modeled as a function of process precision (i.e., standard deviation of the output characteristic) as opposed to previous models where manufacturing cost is a function of part tolerance. This approach is more realistic and does not assume, a priori, a relationship between conventional tolerance and process spread. Rather than allocating conventional tolerances on the assembly parts, we use statistical tolerances that are more pertinent when using a quality loss function. The model adopted makes it possible to investigate the relationship between optimum quality loss and tolerance variations. As expected, the optimum quality loss generally decreases when the tolerance increases. Exceptions may be encountered when changes of process occur. The manufacture of a simple three component assembly is studied to illustrate the findings.},

In this paper cross-sectional area is considered as the measure of group size. Designs incorporating multiple members with the same cross-sectional area are advantageous when considering the cost of purchasing and fabricating materials. The shape annealing method is used as an approach to solve this problem by incorporating a method for dynamic grouping of members based on cross-sectional area that creates a tradeoff between mass and the number of groups through a weighted objective function that includes a group penalty function.

Structural languages can serve to enhance designer creativity by presenting multiple, spatially innovative, yet functional design solutions while also providing insight into the interaction between structural form and the trade-offs involved in multi-objective design. The style of the structures within a language is a product of the shape grammar that defines the allowable structural forms and the optimization model that provides a functional measure of the generated forms to determine the desirable designs. This paper presents an application of geodesic dome patterns that have been embodied in a shape grammar to define a structural language of domes. Within this language of domes, different dome styles are generated by changing the optimization model for dome design to include the design goals of maximum enclosure space, minimum surface area, minimum number of distinct cross-sectional areas, and visual uniformity. The strengths of the method that will be shown are 1) the generation of both conventional domes similar to shape optimization results and spatially innovative domes, 2) the generation of design alternatives within a defined design style, and 3) the generation of different design styles by modifying the language semantics provided by the optimization model.},

	abstract = {A computational model of problem solving based on significant aspects of human problem solving is introduced. It is observed that during problem solving humans often start searching more or less randomly, becoming more deterministic over time as they learn more about the problem. This two-phase aspect of problem-solving behavior and its relation to learning is one of the important features this model accounts for. The model uses an accelerated simulated annealing technique as a search mechanism within a real-time dynamic programming-like framework upon a connected graph of neighboring problem states. The objective value of each node is adjusted as the model moves between nodes, learning more accurate values for the nodes and also compensating for misleading heuristic information as it does so. In this manner the model is shown to learn to more effectively solve isomorphs of the Balls and Boxes and Tower of Hanoi problems. The major issues investigated with the model are (a) whether such a simulated annealing-based model exhibits the kind of random-to-directed transition in behavior exhibited by people, and (b) whether the progressive discovery of the objective function, even when given very little or poor initial information, is a plausible method for representing the learning that occurs during problem solving and the knowledge that results from that learning.},

The measurement points are a subset of the true surface, and, consequently, the extreme fit result differs from the true value. In this paper, we investigate the functional relationship between the uncertainty in an extreme fit and the number of points measured. Two major issues are addressed in this paper. The first addresses and identifies the parameters that affect the functional relationship. The second develops a methodology to apply this relationship to the sampling of measurement points.},

	abstract = {A grammatical approach to product design is demonstrated. 
In particular, shape grammars are shown to be especially
useful for products that are differentiated primarily on
the basis of form yet driven by function; they allow products
to be designed as a sequence of well-defined steps. However,
it is not always clear how to choose the sequence of rules
that should be applied to generate the final shape. In
this paper we demonstrate that at each stage during the
process, partial designs of the final product can be used
to provide feedback to the designer based on specific design
objectives and thus suggest possible rule choices. We take
advantage of the shape grammar for the generation of coffeemakers introduced by Agarwal and Cagan, and associate with the
grammar rules expressions that model manufacturing costs.
With each application of a shape grammar rule, an understanding
of the overall cost of manufacturing the product is incrementally improved. Thus, at each stage of the design process the
designer has an indication of what the overall cost of
the product will be and how the selection of one grammar
rule over another influences the final cost. Once the complete
product is generated, an appraisal of its manufacturing
cost is given to the designer. This evaluation methodology
helps the designer understand the implications of decisions
made early on in the design process. We have also verified
the accuracy of this approach through the costs of some
commercially available coffeemakers, generated by this
method, which are comparable to the costs for those designs
listed in the literature.},

The nature of such techniques, however, does not allow the user to interact with the search process once it has begun. Furthermore, traditional computational search lacks the ability to learn from experience. While computational search techniques have the ability to search many design alternatives quickly, the human engineer can often arrive at a more elegant and robust solution by applying heuristics learned from past experiences. The method introduced here improves the capabilities of design synthesis methods by allowing for user input and by making decisions based on previous experience. In studying past candidate designs the process learns to be more effective in searching for solutions. Results show how such a technique improves the quality of designs and efficiency of an existing search process.},

The search for optimal positions and orientations of parts in the layout typically requires a huge number of iterations. An extended pattern search layout algorithm based on coordinate search was introduced in an earlier paper and shown quite effective over the previous state-of-the-art. Coordinate search is a simple and straightforward way of implementing the extended pattern search method in the layout problem. However, it is not taking advantage of the wide variety of heuristics admissible in pattern search methods for identifying promising search directions. By introducing various search patterns and exploring their effectiveness in the layout problem, the question of whether complex tactics can do better than the basic coordinate pattern search is addressed. This paper presents four different heuristics for generating pattern directions in the extended pattern search layout algorithm: the conjugate direction method, the modified gradient method, the rank ordering method, and the simplex method. These heuristics are utilized to identify promising search directions and update the set of pattern directions used in the algorithm over iterations. The performance of the different heuristics is compared to that of the basic coordinate extended pattern search layout approach.},

computational teaming. A computational team-based model, designed to more fully integrate agent ties, is created and presented. It is applied to a bulk manufacturing process-planning problem and its performance compared against a previously tested agent-based algorithm without these agent relationships. The performance of the new agent method showed significant improvement over the previous method: improving solution quality 280\% and increasing solution identification per unit time an entire order of magnitude. A statistical examination of the new algorithm confirms that agent interdependencies are the strongest and most consistent performance effects leading to the observed improvements. This study illustrates that the interagent ties associated with team collaboration can be a highly effective method of improving computational design performance, and the results are promising indications that the application of organization constructs within a computational context may significantly improve computational problem solving.},

The first study examines recall of mechanical devices and chunking of components, and the second examines whether seniors represent devices in a more abstract functional manner than do freshmen. The most prominent differences between these 2 groups involve their representation of the functioning of groups of electromechanical components and how these groups of components interact to produce device behavior. Seniors are better able to construct coherent representations of devices by focusing on the function of sets of components in the device. The findings from these studies highlight some ways in which the structure and content of mental representations of design knowledge differ during the early stages of expertise acquisition.},

	abstract = {Generalized pattern search (GPS) algorithms have been used successfully to solve three-dimensional (3D) component layout problems. These algorithms use a set of patterns and successively decreasing step sizes of these patterns to explore the search space before converging to good local minima. A shortcoming of conventional GPS algorithms is the lack of recognition of the fact that patterns affect the objective function by different amounts and hence it might be efficient to introduce them into the search in a certain order rather than introduce all of them at the beginning of the search. To address this shortcoming, it has been shown by the authors in previous work that it is more efficient to schedule patterns in decreasing order of their effect on the objective function. The effect of the patterns on the objective function was estimated by the a priori expectation of the objective function change due to the patterns. However, computing the a priori expectation is expensive, and to practically implement the scheduling of patterns, an inexpensive estimate of the effect on the objective function is necessary. This paper introduces a metric for geometric layout called the sensitivity metric that is computationally inexpensive, to estimate the effect of pattern moves on the objective function. A new pattern search algorithm that uses the sensitivity metric to schedule patterns is shown to perform as well as the pattern search algorithm that used the a priori expectation of the objective function change. Though the sensitivity metric applies to the class of geometric layout or placement problems, the foundation and approach is useful for developing metrics for other optimization problems.},

Observations from 3D component layout motivate the question whether patterns should be introduced in some different order during the search. This paper presents a novel method for scheduling patterns that is inspired by observations from 3D component layout problems. The new method introduces patterns into the search in the decreasing order of a priori expectation of the objective function change due to the patterns. Pattern search algorithms based on the new pattern schedule run 30\% faster on average than conventional pattern search based algorithms on 3D component layout problems and general 2D multimodal surface minimization problems.

	abstract = {One of the greatest challenges in product development is creating a form that is aesthetically attractive to an intended market audience. Market research tools, such as consumer surveys, are well established for functional product features, but aesthetic preferences are as varied as the people that respond to them. Additionally, and possibly even more challenging, user feedback requires objective measurement and quantification of aesthetics and aesthetic preference. The common methods for quantifying aesthetics present respondents with metric scales over dimensions with abstract semantic labels like “strong” and “sexy.” Even if researchers choose the correct semantics to test, and even if respondents accurately record their responses on these semantic scales, the results on the semantic scales must be translated back into a product shape, where the designer must take the consumers’ numerical scores for a set of semantics and translate that into a form which consumers will find desirable. This translation presents a potential gap in understanding between the supply and demand sides of the marketplace. This gap between designer and user can be closed through objective methods to understand and quantify aesthetic preferences because the designer would have concrete directions to use as a foundation for development of the product form. Additionally, the quantification of aesthetic preference could be used by the designer as evidence to support certain product forms when engineering and manufacturing decisions are made that might adversely affect the aesthetics of the product form. This paper demonstrates how the qualitative attribute, form, cannot only be represented quantitatively, but also how customer preferences can be estimated as utility functions over the aesthetic space, so that new higher utility product forms can be proposed and explored. To do so, the form is summarized with underlying latent form characteristics, and these underlying characteristics are specified to be attributes in a utility function. Consumer surveys, created using design of experiments, are then used to capture an individual’s preference for the indicated attributes and thus the form. Once preference is summarized in the utility function, the utility function can be used as the basis for form generation and modification or design verification.},

An essential element in achieving a team’s problem-solving potential is the role that interdependence, in both the task and the organization, plays in determining the dynamic and emergent system-level properties of the organization. In this paper, we present a computational platform for experimentally investigating the influence of informational dependencies found in the design of a complex system for exploring their role in determining system behaviors and performance. The approach presented in this paper is a multiagent simulation of the conceptual design of space mission plans by Team X, an advanced project design group at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The algorithm is composed of rich descriptive models of both the team-types and timing of interactions, collaborative methods, sequencing, rates of convergence- and the task-primary variables, their behaviors and relations, and the approaches used to resolve them. The objective is to create an environment of interaction representative of that found in actual design sessions. Better understanding how the dynamics arising from organizational and domain interdependencies impact an organization’s ability to effectively resolve its task should lead to the development of guidelines for better coping with task complexities, suggest ways to better design organizations, as well as suggest ways for improving the search for innovative solutions.},

Findings The paper illustrates how the VOA was used as a tool for evaluating and crafting both a brand identity, and shows how the brand identity translates into product specifications so that products embody, communicate, and deliver the brand identity. Research limitations/implications Although the VOA has been used in diverse markets (business to business, consumer software, physical product), in this article the VOA is illustrated in the context of brand identity for physical products. Future studies should illustrate how the application of the method may vary across domains. Practical implications This approach will appeal to executives, brand managers and product managers who have a goal of maintaining a differentiated brand identity and clearly delivering brand values through the products in the brand portfolio. Originality/value Products serve as influential sources of information about a brand's identity. The paper treats the brand as a product to be designed, adapting an analytical approach to translate customer value into brand identity and ultimately into the specification of the products, to ensure that all are aligned to answer the marketplace needs in a way that differs from competitors.},

Our goal is to demonstrate and understand how such dynamically evolving teams may search more effectively than any single agent or a priori set strategy. We present a core framework and methodology that has potential applications in layout, scheduling, manufacturing, and other engineering design areas. The communal agent team organizational structure employed allows cooperation of agents through the products of their work and creates an ever changing set of individual solutions for the agents to work on. In addition, the organizational structure allows the framework to be adaptive to changes in the design space that may occur during the optimization process. An evolutionary approach is used, but evolution occurs at the strategic rather than the solution level, where the strategies of agents in the team are the decisions for when and how to choose and alter a solution, and the agents evolve over time. As an application of this approach in a static domain, individual solutions are tours in the familiar combinatorial optimization problem of the traveling salesman. With a constantly changing set of these tours, the team, with each agent employing a different solution strategy, must evolve to apply the solution strategies, which are most useful given the solution set at any point in the process. We discuss the extensions to our preliminary work that will make our framework useful to the design and optimization community.},

Three conditions are compared, a control, a fixation group whom were provided with an example solution, and a defixation group whom were also given materials to mitigate their design fixation. Measures include indicators of design fixation and participant perceptions. The study demonstrates that the engineering design faculty show statistically significant evidence of design fixation, but only partially perceive its effects. This study also indicates that design fixation can be mitigated. The group of participants in this study, due to their background in engineering design research and experience with student design teams, was expected to have more accurate perceptions or awareness of design fixation than the typical participant. Understanding the incongruities between participant perceptions and quantitative design outcomes are particularly of interest to researchers of design methods. For this study, clear evidence exists that designers, even those that study and teach design on a regular basis, do not know when they are being influenced or fixated by misleading or poor information.},

Specifically, the study considers the influence of the type of information received prior to problem solving on team convergence over time, as well as on the quality of produced solutions. To understand convergence, a model of the team members’ solution approach was developed through a cognitive engineering design study, specifically examining the effect of the introduction of a poor example solution or a good example solution prior to problem solving on the quality of the produced solutions. Latent semantic analysis was used to track the teams’ convergence, and the quality of design solutions was systematically assessed using pre-established criteria and multiple evaluators. Introducing a poor example solution was shown to decrease teams’ convergence over time, as well as the quality of their design solution; introducing a good example solution did not produce a statistically significant different effect on convergence compared with the control (with no prior example solution provided) but did lead to higher quality solutions.},

	abstract = {In this work we investigate how consumers make preference judgments when taking into account both product form and function. In prior work, where aesthetic preference is quantified using visual conjoint methods, aesthetic preference and functional preference were handled separately. Here we introduce a new methodology for testing the hypothesis that when consumers make decisions taking into account both a product’s form and its function they employ a more complex decision making strategy than when basing their decision on form or function alone. We believe that this strategy will involve both cognitive and emotional processes. We used a two stage conjoint analysis to develop a preference function that takes both form and function into account. When compared with participant ratings of form and function combinations across 14 subjects, the model is shown to have a correlation of approximately 0.56, p {\textless} 0.001. Next we developed a novel paradigm using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine what parts of the brain are primarily involved with any given tradeoff between form and function. While in the scanner, study participants were asked to make decisions between options where only form varied, where only function varied, and where form and function both varied. Results from 7 participants suggest that choices based on products that vary in both form and function involve some unique and some common brain networks as choices based on form or function alone; most important, emotion-related regions are activated during these complex decisions where form and function are in conflict. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using fMRI to address questions about the mental processes underlying consumer decisions.},

In this work, a taxonomy of heuristic optimization approaches is introduced and used to motivate a new approach called protocol-based multi-agent systems. This approach is found to produce final solutions of much higher quality when its implementation includes the use of multiple search protocols, the adaptation of these protocols during the optimization, and the cooperation between these protocols than when these characteristics are absent.},

An impasse is a point in  problem solving at which a problem solver is not making progress and does not  know how to proceed. In both studies, work on remote associates problems was  suspended before an impasse was reached, at the time an impasse was reached, or  after a period of continued work during an impasse. After problem solving was  suspended on a set of problems, participants completed a lexical decision task  before resuming work on the set of unsolved problems. For half of the problems  suspended during each impasse state, solution words were presented as incidental  hints in the lexical decision task. The proportion of initially unsolved problems  that were solved after the intervening lexical decision task was greater when  problem solving was suspended at the point an impasse was reached than when  problem solving was suspended before an impasse or after a period of continued  work during an impasse. These results suggest that suspending problem solving at  the point of impasse may increase susceptibility to incidentally presented hints.

Understanding these properties is critical for effectively harnessing the power of analogy. The current research explores how variations in analogical distance, commonness, and representation modality influence the effects of examples on conceptual ideation. Senior-level engineering students generated solution concepts for an engineering design problem with or without provided examples drawn from the U.S. Patent database. Examples were crossed by analogical distance (near-field vs. far-field), commonness (more vs. less-common), and modality (picture vs. text). A control group that received no examples was included for comparison. Effects were examined on a mixture of ideation process and product variables. Our results show positive effects of far-field and less-common examples on novelty and variability in quality of solution concepts. These effects are not modulated by modality. However, detailed analyses of process variables suggest divergent inspiration pathways for far-field vs. less-common examples. Additionally, the combination of far-field, less-common examples resulted in more novel concepts than in the control group. These findings suggest guidelines for the effective design and implementation of design-by-analogy methods, particularly a focus on far-field, less-common examples during the ideation process.},

The effect of each variable is measured using the problem objective function as a metric. Increasing the amount of cooperation in the evolving team is shown to lead to improved performance for several multimodal and complex numerical optimization and three-dimensional layout problems. However, fitness functions that utilize team-based rewards are found to be inferior to those that reward on an individual basis. The performance trends for different fitness functions and levels of cooperation remain when EMAS is applied to the more complex problem of three-dimensional packing as well.},

	abstract = {An extended pattern search approach is presented for the optimization of the placement of wind turbines on a wind farm. Problem-specific extensions infuse stochastic characteristics into the deterministic pattern search, inhibiting convergence on local optima and yielding better results than pattern search alone. The optimal layout for a wind farm is considered here to be one that maximizes the power generation of the farm while minimizing the farm cost. To estimate the power output, an established wake model is used to account for the aerodynamic effects of turbine blades on downstream wind speed, as the oncoming wind speed for any turbine is proportional to the amount of power the turbine can produce. As turbines on a wind farm are in close proximity, the interaction of turbulent wakes developed by the turbines can have a significant effect on the power development capability of the farm. The farm cost is estimated using an accepted simplified model that is a function of the number of turbines. The algorithm develops a two-dimensional layout for a given number of turbines, performing local turbine movement while applying global evaluation. Three test cases are presented: (a) constant, unidirectional wind, (b) constant, multidirectional wind, and (c) varying, multidirectional wind. The purpose of this work is to explore the ability of an extended pattern search (EPS) algorithm to solve the wind farm layout problem, as EPS has been shown to be particularly effective in solving multimodal layout problems. It is also intended to show that the inclusion of extensions into the algorithm can better inform the search than algorithms that have been previously presented in the literature. Resulting layouts created by this extended pattern search algorithm develop more power than previously explored algorithms using the same evaluation models and objective functions. In addition, the algorithm’s resulting layouts motivate a heuristic that aids in the manual development of the best layout found to date. The results of this work validate the application of an extended pattern search algorithm to the wind farm layout problem, and that its performance is enhanced by the use of problem-specific extensions that aid in developing results that are superior to those developed by previous algorithms.},

	abstract = {Great design often results from intelligently balancing tradeoffs and leveraging of synergies between multiple product goals. While the engineering design community has numerous tools for managing the interface between functional goals in products, there are currently no formalized methods to concurrently optimize stylistic form and functional requirements. This research develops a method to coordinate seemingly disparate but highly related goals of stylistic form and functional constraints in computational design. An artificial neural network (ANN) based machine learning system was developed to model surveyed consumer judgments of stylistic form quantitatively. Coupling this quantitative model of stylistic form with a genetic algorithm (GA) enables computers to concurrently account for multiple objectives in the domains of stylistic form and more traditional functional performance evaluation within the same quantitative framework. This coupling then opens the door for computers to automatically generate products that not only work well but also convey desired styles to consumers.},

We hypothesized that that laws exist that describe system functioning at one level, independently of the configuration at other levels. The hypothesis was tested using simulations of motor protein systems, and demonstrated that patterns in their behavior emerge at a systems level. Results demonstrated a law concerning energy utilization predicts the lifetime of these systems before dissociation, regardless of the components present in the system. These findings reveal organizational laws that simplify complex systems analysis and can facilitate engineering design approaches for bio-based technologies.},

	abstract = {Complex systems are challenging to understand and design, and even more so when considering nanoscale reasoning. This paper introduces a synergistic cognitive and agent-based methodology for deriving effective strategies for human searches in optimization design tasks. The method consists of conducting cognitive studies to determine effective human search approaches, rapidly testing algorithmic variations of human strategies using software agent automation, and finally providing the highly effective agent-refined strategies to humans. The methodology was implemented by developing a graphical user interface (GUI) of myosin biomotors and conducting a baseline cognitive study to determine how users effectively search for optimal biosystem designs. The best human designers typically searched local to their current best solution, utilized univariate searches, and may have learned and applied parametric knowledge. These trends informed rule-based agent strategies, and testing variations of rules resulted in the discovery of highly effective strategies using initial random searches, univariate searches to learn parameter relationships, and greedy local searches to apply knowledge. The GUI was modified to aid users in implementing two of the highest performing agent strategies in a final cognitive study. These users provided with the agent-refined strategy performed better than users with no provided strategy during the baseline cognitive study. When agents and users were provided myosin domain knowledge prior to searching, convergence on high-quality designs occurred earlier, which suggests that even experts in the domain could benefit from the agent-derived strategies. These findings demonstrate the power of synergistic human- and agent-based approaches, in which cognitive-based findings can reveal strategies that are refined by agents that generate search strategies for greatly improved user performance. The synergistic methodology extends beyond nano-based applications and could generally aid designers in discovering effective decision-making approaches across a broad range of domains.},

The study aims to characterize information types that facilitate human learning and improve their complex system understanding and design proficiency. It is hypothesized that learning parametric system relationships and/or inter-level causal mechanisms improves design proficiency; these relationships and mechanisms are teachable through software interfaces. Two contrasting learning/design interfaces were developed that presented differing information types: an interface with performance charts that emphasized parametric relationship learning and an interface with agent-based animations that emphasized inter-level causality learning. Users improved on pre-/post-learning design tasks with both interfaces; users who demonstrated inter-level causal relationship understanding, which occurred primarily with the animation interface, had greater improvement. All users were then presented contrasting animations of systems with opposing emergent behaviors, resulting in many more participants demonstrating an understanding of inter-level causal behaviors. These findings reveal the difficulties in understanding and designing multi-level systems and that interactive software tools may convey crucial information that supports engineering design, particularly with respect to the development of reasoning skills for how system components relate across levels.},

These modeling advances include accurate cost and power modeling, partial wake interaction, and the effects of varying atmospheric stability. To validate the use of this advanced modeling system, it is employed within an Extended Pattern Search (EPS)-Multi-Agent System (MAS) optimization approach for multiple wind scenarios. The wind farm layout optimization problem involves optimizing the position and size of wind turbines such that the aerodynamic effects of upstream turbines are reduced, which increases the effective wind speed and resultant power at each turbine. The EPS-MAS optimization algorithm employs a profit objective, and an overarching search determines individual turbine positions, with a concurrent EPS-MAS determining the optimal hub height and rotor diameter for each turbine. Two wind cases are considered: (1) constant, unidirectional wind, and (2) three discrete wind speeds and varying wind directions, each of which have a probability of occurrence. Results show the advantages of applying the series of advanced models compared to previous application of an EPS with less advanced models to wind farm layout optimization, and imply best practices for computational optimization of wind farms with improved accuracy.},

	abstract = {This purpose of this work is to explore means of optimizing multi-stage wind farms using two derivative-free optimization methods: a hybrid Extended Pattern Search/Genetic Algorithm (capitalizing on the benefits of each), and a multi-objective Extended Pattern Search. Large onshore wind farms are often installed in discrete phases, with smaller sub-farms being installed and becoming operational in succession, creating the completed large wind farm in a piece-wise fashion over multiple years. Multi-stage wind farms present a complex and relevant optimization challenge in that in addition to accounting for the site-specific objectives of a wind farm (such as power development and profit), optimization of both the discrete sub-farms and the completed farm must be jointly considered. Two different problem formulations are explored: the first uses the optimal layout of a complete farm and then systematically “removes” turbines to create smaller sub-farms; the second uses a weighted multi-objective optimization over sequential, adjacent land that concurrently optimizes each sub-farm and the complete farm. For both problem formulations, two wind test cases are considered for both a square and a rectangular field: a constant wind speed from a predominant wind direction, and a multidirectional test case with three wind speeds and a defined probability of occurrence for each. The exploration of these resulting layouts indicates the value of the advanced multi-objective EPS and the hybrid EPS/GA, and gives insight into how to approach optimizing both completed wind farms and sub-farm stages. The behavior exhibited in these tests cases suggests strategies that can be employed by wind farm developers to facilitate predictable, optimal performance of multi-stage wind farms throughout their useful life.},

When interaction effects are negligible, a main effects fractional factorial experimental design can be used to reduce data requirements and survey cost. This is particularly important when the presence of many parameters or levels makes full factorial designs intractable. However, if interaction effects are relevant, main effects design can create biased estimates and lead to erroneous conclusions. This work investigates consumer preference interactions in the nontraditional context of visual choice-based conjoint analysis, where the conjoint attributes are parameters that define a product's shape. Although many conjoint studies assume interaction effects to be negligible, they may play a larger role for shape parameters. The role of interaction effects is explored in two visual conjoint case studies. The results suggest that interactions can be either negligible or dominant in visual conjoint, depending on consumer preferences. Generally, we suggest using randomized designs to avoid any bias resulting from the presence of interaction effects.},

	abstract = {New opportunities in design surface with scientific advances: however, the rapid pace of scientific discoveries combined with the complexity of technical barriers often impedes new product development. Bio-based technologies, for instance, typically require decisions across complex multiscale system organizations that are difficult for humans to understand and formalize computationally. This paper addresses such challenges in science and design by weaving phases of empirical discovery, analytical description, and technological development in an integrative “D3 Methodology.” The phases are bridged with human-guided computational processes suitable for human-in-the-loop design approaches. Optimization of biolibraries, which are sets of standardized biological parts for adaptation into new products, is used as a characteristic design problem for demonstrating the methodology. Results from this test case suggest that biolibraries with synthetic biological components can promote the development of high-performance bio-based products. These new products motivate further scientific studies to characterize designed synthetic biological components, thus illustrating reciprocity among science and design. Successes in implementing each phase suggest the D3 Methodology is a feasible route for bio-based research and development and for driving the scientific inquiries of today toward the novel technologies of tomorrow.},

	abstract = {Fixation on inappropriate concepts is a key barrier to problem solving. Previous research has shown that continuous work is likely to cause repeated retrieval of those concepts, resulting in increased fixation. Accordingly, distributing effort across problems through multiple, brief, and interlaced sessions (distributed effort) should prevent such fixation and in turn enhance problem solving. This study examined whether distributed effort can provide an advantage for problem solving, particularly for problems that can induce fixation (Experiment 1), and whether and how incubation can be combined with distributed effort to further enhance performance (Experiment 2). Remote Associates Test (RAT) problems were used as the problem-solving tasks. Half of them (i.e., misleading RAT) were more likely to mislead individuals to fixate on incorrect associates than the other half. Experiments revealed a superiority of distributed over massed effort on misleading RAT performance and a differing time course of incubation for the massed and distributed groups. We conclude that distributed effort facilitates problem solving, most likely via overcoming fixation. Cognitive mechanisms other than the commonly posited forgetting of inappropriate ideas may occur during incubation to facilitate problem solving. The experiments in this article offer support for the occurrence of spreading activation during incubation.},

However, a team having the wrong characteristics may perform more poorly than the sum of its individuals. Therefore, it is vital that teams are assembled and managed properly in order to maximize performance. This work examines how the properties of configuration design problems can be leveraged to select the best values for team characteristics (specifically team size and interaction frequency). A computational model of design teams which has been shown to effectively emulate human team behavior is employed to pinpoint optimized team characteristics for solving a variety of configuration design problems. These configuration design problems are characterized with respect to the local and global structure of the design space, the alignment between objectives, and the resources allotted for solving the problem. Regression analysis is then used to create equations for predicting optimized values for team characteristics based on problem properties. These equations achieve moderate to high accuracy, making it possible to design teams based on those problem properties. Further analysis reveals hypotheses about how the problem properties can influence a team's search for solutions. This work also conducts a cognitive study on a different problem to test the predictive equations. For a configuration problem of moderate size, the model predicts that zero interaction between team members should lead to the best outcome. A cognitive study of human teams verifies this surprising prediction, offering partial validation of the predictive theory.},

This paper theorizes that adding sustainability as a variable during product choice evaluations create decisions that are moral choice scenarios, where benefit to society is weighed against personal gain. From an engineering design perspective, modeling user preferences in this context can be extremely difficult. While several methods exist to assist researchers in eliciting consumer preferences, the vast majority relies upon conscious input from the potential consumers themselves. More critically, these methods do not afford researchers the ability to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying what someone may be feeling or thinking while these preference judgments are being made. In this work, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is used to investigate the neural processes behind multi-attribute product preference judgments. In particular, this work centers on uncovering unique features of sustainable preference judgments: preference judgments that involve products for which the environmental impact is a known quantity. This work builds upon earlier work that investigated how preference judgments are altered in the context of sustainability. A deeper look at participant decision making at the time of judgment is examined using neuroimaging with the goal of providing actionable insights for designers and product developers.},

These data are incorporated into the design process in an effort to more effectively meet customer requirements. Often these data are used to construct a model of consumer preference capable of evaluating candidate designs. Although the mechanics of these models have been extensively studied, there are still some open questions, particularly with respect to models of aesthetic preference. When constructing preference models, simplistic product representations are often favored over high fidelity product models in order to save time and expense. This work investigates how choice of product representation can affect model performance in visual conjoint analysis. Preference models for a single product, a table knife, are derived using three different representation schemes: simple sketches, solid models, and three dimensional (3D)-printed models. Each of these representations is used in a separate conjoint analysis survey. The results from this study show that the choice model based on 3D-printed photopolymer prototypes underperformed. Additionally, consumer responses were inconsistent and potentially contradictory between different representations. Consequently, when using conjoint analysis for product innovation, obtaining a true understanding of consumer preference requires selecting representations based on how accurately they convey the product details in question.},

By engaging in this search, designers not only improve solution quality but also begin to learn what operational patterns might improve the solution in future iterations. Previous work in psychology has demonstrated that humans can fluently and adeptly learn short operational sequences that aid problem-solving. This paper explores how designers learn and employ sequences within the realm of engineering design. Specifically, this work analyzes behavioral patterns in two human studies in which participants solved configuration design problems. Behavioral data from the two studies are first analyzed using Markov chains to determine how much representation complexity is necessary to quantify the sequential patterns that designers employ during solving. It is discovered that first-order Markov chains are capable of accurately representing designers' sequences. Next, the ability to learn first-order sequences is implemented in an agent-based modeling framework to assess the performance implications of sequence-learning abilities. These computational studies confirm the assumption that the ability to learn sequences is beneficial to designers.},

Various theoretical approaches have been offered for solving configuration type problems, but few studies have examined the approach that humans naturally use to solve such problems. This work applies data-mining techniques to quantitatively study the processes that designers use to solve configuration design problems. The guiding goal is to extract beneficial design process heuristics that are generalizable to the entire class of problems. The extraction of these human problem-solving heuristics is automated through the application of hidden Markov models to the data from two behavioral studies. Results show that designers proceed through four procedural states in solving configuration design problems, roughly transitioning from topology design to shape and parameter design. High-performing designers are distinguished by their opportunistic tuning of parameters early in the process, enabling a more effective and nuanced search for solutions.},

	abstract = {Biological complexity presents challenges for understanding natural phenomenon and engineering new technologies, particularly in systems with molecular heterogeneity. Such complexity is present in myosin motor protein systems, and computational modeling is essential for determining how collective myosin interactions produce emergent system behavior. We develop a computational approach for altering myosin isoform parameters and their collective organization, and support predictions with in vitro experiments of motility assays with α-actinins as molecular force sensors. The computational approach models variations in single myosin molecular structure, system organization, and force stimuli to predict system behavior for filament velocity, energy consumption, and robustness. Robustness is the range of forces where a filament is expected to have continuous velocity and depends on used myosin system energy. Myosin systems are shown to have highly nonlinear behavior across force conditions that may be exploited at a systems level by combining slow and fast myosin isoforms heterogeneously. Results suggest some heterogeneous systems have lower energy use near stall conditions and greater energy consumption when unloaded, therefore promoting robustness. These heterogeneous system capabilities are unique in comparison with homogenous systems and potentially advantageous for high performance bionanotechnologies. Findings open doors at the intersections of mechanics and biology, particularly for understanding and treating myosin-related diseases and developing approaches for motor molecule-based technologies.},

Dyads were asked to work on idea generation tasks (Experiment 1) or category–exemplar generation tasks (Experiment 2). In both experiments, dyads had to perform the tasks in either a continuous or an alternating condition. The continuous dyads worked on one task continuously before proceeding to another. The alternating dyads switched between tasks. Both experiments found a positive role of task alternation. Moreover, the performance gap between the alternating and continuous dyads increased over time.

Participants (N = 156) solved 20 verbal puzzles either alone quietly, alone thinking-aloud, or in verbalizing pairs. Participants in the same working-alone condition were randomly paired to form nominal pairs and their pooled performance was treated as nominal group performance. Relative to the quiet nominal group, the performance of the thinking-aloud nominal and interacting groups were impaired to similar extents. These two groups also demonstrated a similar limited capacity to expand the search scope.

	abstract = {Teams are a major feature of engineering and are commonly thought to be necessary when solving dynamic and complex problems. Even though teams collectively provide a diversity of knowledge, skills, and perspectives to problem-solving, previous work has demonstrated that in certain scenarios, such as in language-based and more spatially oriented configuration design problems, the production by a team is inferior to that of a similar number of individuals working independently (i.e., nominal team). This research explores this comparison of individual versus group problem-solving within the domain of conceptual engineering design. Thus, a behavioral study was run with freshman engineering students, who solved a conceptual engineering design problem individually or collaboratively in a team. Results corroborate previous findings, exhibiting that individuals outperform teams in the overall quality of their design solutions, even within this more free-flowing and explorative setting of conceptual design. Exploiting this result, this work further considers whether adaptive feedback from a process manager can lessen the underperformance of collaborative design teams compared to individuals, by helping teams overcome potential deterrents that may be contributing to their inferior performance. Teams that are under the guidance of a process manager end up performing better than teams that are not in terms of solution quality, and almost as well as individuals, though not significantly different. This result suggests that process managers are able to mitigate some of the deficiencies in design teams. In an attempt to uncover some of the cognitive rationale and strategies that may be beneficial throughout problem-solving, the managerial interactions with the design teams are then investigated. Furthermore, to determine the reason of the collaborative teams’ underperformance, the effect of verbalization is studied as a possible cognitive hindrance. In the end, this work expands growing research on team problem-solving in engineering, and suggests that collaborative teams may not be optimal in every circumstance, but under the proper process management, can become substantially more effective.},

	abstract = {Inspirational stimuli, such as analogies, are a prominent mechanism used to support designers. However, generating relevant inspirational stimuli remains challenging. This work explores the potential of using an untrained crowd workforce to generate stimuli for trained designers. Crowd workers developed solutions for twelve open-ended design problems from the literature. Solutions were text-mined to extract words along a frequency domain, which, along with computationally derived semantic distances, partitioned stimuli into closer or further distance categories for each problem. The utility of these stimuli was tested in a human subjects experiment (N = 96). Results indicate crowdsourcing holds potential to gather impactful inspirational stimuli for open-ended design problems. Near stimuli improve the feasibility and usefulness of designs solutions, while distant stimuli improved their uniqueness.},

	abstract = {A multitude of studies in economics, psychology, political and social sciences have demonstrated the wisdom of crowds (WoC) phenomenon, where the collective estimate of a group can be more accurate than estimates of individuals. While WoC is observable in such domains where the participating individuals have experience or familiarity with the question at hand, it remains unclear how effective WoC is for domains that traditionally require deep expertise or sophisticated computational models to estimate objective answers. This work explores how effective WoC is for engineering design problems that are esoteric in nature, that is, problems (1) whose solutions traditionally require expertise and specialized knowledge, (2) where access to experts can be costly or infeasible, and (3) in which previous WoC studies with the general population have been shown to be highly ineffective. The main hypothesis in this work is that in the absence of experts, WoC can be observed in groups that consist of practitioners who are defined to have a base familiarity with the problems in question but not necessarily domain experts. As a way to emulate commonly encountered engineering problem-solving scenarios, this work studies WoC with practitioners that form microcrowds consisting of 5–15 individuals, thereby giving rise to the term the wisdom of microcrowds (WoMC). Our studies on design evaluations show that WoMC produces results whose mean is in the 80th percentile or better across varying crowd sizes, even for problems that are highly nonintuitive in nature.},

In the field of medical imaging, one challenge with applying machine learning techniques is the limited size and relative expense of obtaining labeled data. For example, in glenoid labral tears, current imaging diagnosis is best achieved by imaging through magnetic resonance (MR) arthrography, a method of injecting contrast-enhancing material into the joint that can potentially cause discomfort to the patient, and adds expense compared to a standard magnetic resonance image (MRI). This work proposes limiting the use of MR arthrography through a medical diagnostic approach, based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning from a separate medical imaging dataset to improve the efficiency and effectiveness. The results indicate an effective method applied to a small dataset of unenhanced shoulder MRI in order to diagnose labral tear severity while potentially significantly reducing cost and reducing unnecessary invasive imaging techniques. The proposed method ultimately can reduce physician workload while ensuring that the least number of patients as possible need to be subjected to an additional invasive contrast-enhanced imaging procedure.},

Hence, if agents can learn from human behavior, a synergetic human-agent problem-solving team can be created. This paper presents an approach to extract human design strategies and implicit rules, purely from historical human data, and use that for design generation. A two-step framework that learns to imitate human design strategies from observation is proposed and implemented. This framework makes use of deep learning constructs to learn to generate designs without any explicit information about objective and performance metrics. The framework is designed to interact with the problem through a visual interface as humans did when solving the problem. It is trained to imitate a set of human designers by observing their design state sequences without inducing problem-specific modeling bias or extra information about the problem. Furthermore, an end-to-end agent is developed that uses this deep learning framework as its core in conjunction with image processing to map pixel-to-design moves as a mechanism to generate designs. Finally, the designs generated by a computational team of these agents are then compared with actual human data for teams solving a truss design problem. Results demonstrate that these agents are able to create feasible and efficient truss designs without guidance, showing that this methodology allows agents to learn effective design strategies.},

While they offer an effective means for searching a design space, standard grammars risk being computationally costly because of the iteration required, and the larger a given grammar the broader the search required. This paper proposes a two-tiered design grammar that enhances the computational design generation with generalized heuristics to provide a way to more efficiently search a design space. Specifically, this two-tiered grammar captures a combination of heuristic-based strategic actions (often observed in human designers) and smaller-scale modifications (common in traditional grammars). Rules in the higher tier are abstract and applicable across multiple design domains. Through associated guiding heuristics, these macrorules are translated down into a sequence of domain-specific, lower-tier microrules. This grammar is evaluated through an implementation within an agent-based simulated annealing team algorithm in which agents iteratively select actions from either the higher tier or the lower tier. This algorithm is used in two applications: truss generation, which is commonly used for testing engineering design methods, and wave energy converter design generation, which is currently a relevant research area in sustainable energy production. Comparisons are made between designs generated using only lower-tier rules and those generated using only higher-tier rules. Further tests demonstrate the efficacy of applying a combination of both lower-tier and higher-tier rules.},

This note presents an approach to represent design strategies using a probabilistic model. The model provides a mechanism to generate new designs based on certain design strategies while solving configuration design task in a sequential manner. This work also demonstrates that this probabilistic representation can be used to transfer strategies from human designers to computational design agents in a way that is general and useful. This transfer-driven approach opens up the possibility of identifying high-performing behavior in human designers and using it to guide computational design agents. Finally, a quintessential behavior of transfer learning is illustrated by agents as transferring design strategies across different problems led to an improvement in agent performance. The work presented in this study leverages the Cognitively Inspired Simulated Annealing Teams (CISAT) framework, an agent-based model that has been shown to mimic human problem-solving in configuration design problems.},

	abstract = {Design activity can be supported using inspirational stimuli (e.g., analogies, patents) by helping designers overcome impasses or in generating solutions with more positive characteristics during ideation. Design researchers typically generate inspirational stimuli a priori in order to investigate their impact. However, for a chosen stimulus to possess maximal utility, it should automatically reflect the current and ongoing progress of the designer. In this work, designers receive computationally selected inspirational stimuli midway through an ideation session in response to the contents of their current solution. Sourced from a broad database of related example solutions, the semantic similarity between the content of the current design and concepts within the database determines which potential stimulus is received. Designers receive a particular stimulus based on three experimental conditions: a semantically near stimulus, a semantically far stimulus, or no stimulus (control). Results indicate that adaptive inspirational stimuli can be determined using latent semantic analysis (LSA) and that semantic similarity measures are a promising approach for real-time monitoring of the design process. The ability to achieve differentiable near versus far stimuli was validated using both semantic cosine similarity values and participant self-response ratings. As a further contribution, this work also explores the impact of different types of adaptive inspirational stimuli on design outcomes using a newly introduced “design innovation” measure. The design innovation measure mathematically captures the overall goodness of a design concept by uniquely combining expert ratings across easier to evaluate subdimensions of feasibility, usefulness, and novelty. While results demonstrate that near inspirational stimuli increase the feasibility of design solutions, they also show the significant impact of the overall inspirational stimulus innovativeness on final design outcomes. In fact, participants are more likely to generate innovative final design solutions when given innovative inspirational stimuli, regardless of their experimental condition.},

	abstract = {Through experience, designers develop guiding principles, or heuristics, to aid decision-making in familiar design domains. Generalized versions of common design heuristics have been identified across multiple domains and applied by novices to design problems. Previous work leveraged a sample of these common heuristics to assist in an agent-based design process, which typically lacks heuristics. These predefined heuristics were translated into sequences of specifically applied design changes that followed the theme of the heuristic. To overcome the upfront burden, need for human interpretation, and lack of generality of this manual process, this paper presents a methodology that induces frequent heuristic sequences from an existing timeseries design change dataset. Individual induced sequences are then algorithmically grouped based on similarity to form groups that each represent a shared general heuristic. The heuristic induction methodology is applied to data from two human design studies in different design domains. The first dataset, collected from a truss design task, finds a highly similar set of general heuristics used by human designers to that which was hand-selected for the previous computational agent study. The second dataset, collected from a cooling system design problem, demonstrates further applicability and generality of the heuristic induction process. Through this heuristic induction technique, designers working in a specified domain can learn from others’ prior problem-solving strategies and use these strategies in their own future design problems.},

	abstract = {Blood vessel networks within the retina are crucial for maintaining tissue perfusion and therefore good vision. Their complexity and unique patterns often require a steep learning curve for humans to identify trends and changes in the shape and topology of the networks, even though there exists much information important to identifying disease within them.    Through image processing, the vasculature is isolated from other features of the fundus images, forcing the viewer to focus on the complex vascular feature. This article  explores an approach using a grammar based on shape to describe retinal vasculature and to generate realistic and increasingly unrealistic artificial vascular networks that are then reviewed by ophthalmologists via digital survey. The ophthalmologists are asked whether these artificial vascular networks appeared realistic or unrealistic.    With only three rules (initiate, branch, and curve), the grammar accomplishes these goals. Networks are generated by adding noise to rule parameters present in existing networks. Via the survey of synthetic networks generated with different noise parameters, a correlation between noise in the branch rule and realistic association is revealed.    By creating a language to describe retinal vasculature, this article allows for the potential of new insight into such an important but less understood feature of the retina, which in the future may play a role in diagnosing or helping to predict types of ocular disease.    Applying shape grammar to describe retinal vasculature permits new understanding, which in turn provides the potential for new diagnostic tools.},

The relative contribution of team members has been largely ignored, especially in the context of engineering design. In this work, a behavioral study was conducted with 78 participants to uncover whether the most or least proficient member of a configuration design team had a larger impact on overall performance. Proficiency is an individual's ability to deal with a specific range of problem. It was found that a configuration design team is most dependent on the proficiency of its most proficient member. The most proficient member had a significant positive effect on how quickly the team reached performance thresholds and the other members of the team were not found to have the same positive impact throughout the design study. Behavioral heuristics were found using hidden Markov modeling to capture the differences in behavior and design strategy between different proficiency members. Results show that high proficiency and low proficiency team members exhibit different behavior, with the most proficient member's behavior leading to topologically simpler designs and other members adopting their designs, leading to the most proficient member driving the team design and thus the team performance. These results underscore the value of the relative contribution model in constructing engineering teams by demonstrating that different team members had unequal effects on team performance. It is shown that enhancing the most proficient member of a team is more likely to contribute to increased team performance than enhancing the least proficient member.},

A major task in fitting a specified model to data is to estimate the value of each parameter in the model. Iterative local methods, such as the Gauss–Newton method and the Levenberg–Marquardt method, are often employed for parameter estimation in nonlinear models. However, practitioners must guess the initial value for each parameter to initialize these iterative local methods. A poor initial guess can contribute to non-convergence of these methods or lead these methods to converge to a wrong or inferior solution. In this paper, a solution interval method is introduced to find the optimal estimator for each parameter in a nonlinear model that minimizes the squared error of the fit. To initialize this method, it is not necessary for practitioners to guess the initial value of each parameter in a nonlinear model. The method includes three algorithms that require different levels of computational power to find the optimal parameter estimators. The method constructs a solution interval for each parameter in the model. These solution intervals significantly reduce the search space for optimal parameter estimators. The method also provides an empirical probability distribution for each parameter, which is valuable for parameter uncertainty assessment. The solution interval method is validated through two case studies in which the Michaelis–Menten model and Fick’s second law are fit to experimental data sets, respectively. These case studies show that the solution interval method can find optimal parameter estimators efficiently. A four-step procedure for implementing the solution interval method in practice is also outlined.},

The proposed architecture integrates methods from sequence learning, model predictive control, and game theory. Computers in this architecture learn objectives and strategies from experimental data to support humans with strategic decisions while operational decisions are made by humans. The paper also presents data-driven methods for partitioning tasks among a team of computers in this architecture. The generalized methodology is illustrated on the real-time strategy game Starcraft II. The results from this application show that low-performing players can benefit from the game-theoretic decision support whereas this support can be overly conservative for high-performing players. The proposed approach provides safe though suboptimal suggestions particularly against an opponent with an unknown level of expertise. The results further show that problem solution with a team of computers based on non-intuitive task partitioning significantly improves the quality of decisions compared to an all-in-one solution with a single computer.},

	abstract = {Human subject experiments are performed to assess the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) agents on distributed human design teams and individual human designers. In the team experiment, participants in teams of six develop and operate a drone fleet to deliver parcels routed to multiple locations of a target market. Among the design teams in the experiment, half of the design teams are human-only teams with no available AI agent. The other half of the design teams, designated as hybrid teams, have drone design and operation AI agents to advise them. Halfway through the team experiment, team structure is changed unexpectedly, requiring participants to adapt to the change. In the individual experiment, participants develop drones based on given design specifications, either on their own or with the availability of a drone design AI agent to advise them. During these experiments, participants configure, test, and share their designs and communicate with their teammates through an online research platform. The platform collects a step-by-step log of the actions made by participants. This article contains data sets collected from 44 teams (264 participants) in the team experiment and 73 participants in the individual experiment. These data sets can be used for behavioral analysis, sequence-based analysis, and natural language processing.},

The particular experimental design, adopted from previous work by the authors, places one of the design team conditions under the guidance of a human process manager. In that work, teams under this process management outperformed the unmanaged teams in terms of their design performance. This opens the opportunity to not only model design discourse during problem-solving, but more critically, to explore process manager interventions and their impact on design cognition. Utilizing this experimental framework, a topic model is trained on the discourse of human designers of both managed and unmanaged teams collaboratively solving a conceptual engineering design task. Results show that the two team conditions significantly differ in a number of the extracted topics and, in particular, those topics that most pertain to the manager interventions. A dynamic look during the design process reveals that the largest differences between the managed and unmanaged teams occur during the latter half of problem-solving. Furthermore, a before and after analysis of the topic-motivated interventions reveals that the process manager interventions significantly shift the topic mixture of the team members’ discourse immediately after intervening. Taken together, these results from this work not only corroborate the effect of the process manager interventions on design team discourse and cognition but provide promise for the computational detection and facilitation of design interventions based on real-time, discourse data.},

Conversely, theories of attention are seldom tested in applied contexts.  Combining application and attention research thus stands to benefit both fields.  Therefore, this study tested three theories of visual attention that are  especially relevant for information processing in emergencies-Load Theory,  Feature Integration Theory, and Dilution Theory-as well as predictions about  attentional guidance and capture of color in a complex visual interface.

	abstract = {Engineering design problems often involve large state and action spaces along with highly sparse rewards. Since an exhaustive search of those spaces is not feasible, humans utilize relevant domain knowledge to condense the search space. Deep learning agents (DLAgents) were previously introduced to use visual imitation learning to model design domain knowledge. This note builds on DLAgents and integrates them with one-step lookahead search to develop goal-directed agents capable of enhancing learned strategies for sequentially generating designs. Goal-directed DLAgents can employ human strategies learned from data along with optimizing an objective function. The visual imitation network from DLAgents is composed of a convolutional encoder–decoder network, acting as a rough planning step that is agnostic to feedback. Meanwhile, the lookahead search identifies the fine-tuned design action guided by an objective. These design agents are trained on an unconstrained truss design problem modeled as a sequential, action-based configuration design problem. The agents are then evaluated on two versions of the problem: the original version used for training and an unseen constrained version with an obstructed construction space. The goal-directed agents outperform the human designers used to train the network as well as the previous feedback-agnostic versions of the agent in both scenarios. This illustrates a design agent framework that can efficiently use feedback to not only enhance learned design strategies but also adapt to unseen design problems.},

However, humans' inappropriate decision to accept or reject suggestions from AI can lead to severe consequences in high-stakes AI-assisted decision-making scenarios. This problem persists due to insufficient understanding of human trust in AI. Therefore, this research studies how two types of human confidence that affect trust, their confidence in AI and confidence in themselves, evolve and affect humans’ decisions. A cognitive study and a quantitative model together examine how changing positive and negative experiences affect these confidences and ultimate decisions. Results show that human self-confidence, not their confidence in AI, directs the decision to accept or reject AI suggestions. Furthermore, this work finds that humans often misattribute blame to themselves and enter a vicious cycle of relying on a poorly performing AI. Findings reveal the need and provide insights to effectively calibrate human self-confidence for successful AI-assisted decision-making.},

To address those challenges, this work introduces Design Strategy network (DSN), a data-driven deep hierarchical framework that can learn strategies over these arbitrary complex action spaces. The hierarchical architecture decomposes every action decision into first predicting a preferred spatial region in the design space and then outputting a probability distribution over a set of possible actions from that region. This framework comprises a convolutional encoder to work with image-based design state representations, a multi-layer perceptron to predict a spatial region, and a weight-sharing network to generate a probability distribution over unordered set-based inputs of feasible actions. Applied to a truss design study, the framework learns to predict the actions of human designers in the study, capturing their truss generation strategies in the process. Results show that DSNs significantly outperform nonhierarchical methods of policy representation, demonstrating their superiority in complex action space problems.},

Automating this activity presents significant opportunities in delivering interventions that dynamically adapt to the state of a team in order to reap the most impact. In this work, an artificial intelligence (AI) agent is created to manage the design process of engineering teams in real time, tracking features of teams’ actions and communications during a complex design and path-planning task in multidisciplinary teams. Teams are also placed under the guidance of human process managers for comparison. Regarding outcomes, teams perform equally as well under both types of management, with trends toward even superior performance from the AI-managed teams. The managers’ intervention strategies and team perceptions of those strategies are also explored, illuminating some intriguing similarities. Both the AI and human process managers focus largely on communication-based interventions, though differences start to emerge in the distribution of interventions across team roles. Furthermore, team members perceive the interventions from both the AI and human manager as equally relevant and helpful, and believe the AI agent to be just as sensitive to the needs of the team. Thus, the overall results show that the AI manager agent introduced in this work is able to match the capabilities of humans, showing potential in automating the management of a complex design process.},

A unit-based design framework is proposed to optimize the channel configuration in order to improve the heat exchange performance (HXP) and meanwhile control the pressure drop (PD) between the fluid inlet and outlet. A gradient-based optimization methodology is employed to drive the design process. Both shape and topology changes are observed during the channel configuration evolution. Moreover, AM printability evaluation is considered and some re-design work is proposed to improve the printability of the designs with respect to the metal laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process. For an optimized structure from the unit-based design, corner rounding operation is adopted first, specifically to avoid sharp features. Then the building process of the entire HX containing top, bottom caps, side walls, and the optimized thin-walled channels is simulated, and residual deformation is predicted through sequential layer-by-layer analysis. Based on the residual deformation profile, geometrical compensation is implemented to reduce geometrical inaccuracy of the printed HX. In addition, build orientation selection is also studied to avoid overhang issues in some specific unit-based design results. Finally, a mature design scheme for the cross-flow HX can be achieved as the solution that leads to largely improved HXP (e.g., nearly 200\% increase), well controlled PD, and enhanced printability with respect to the LPBF AM process.},

Recently, deep learning has shown the ability to learn from large-scale data, enabling significant advances in data-driven design. However, learning over prior data limits us only to solve problems that have been solved before and biases data-driven learning toward existing solutions. The ultimate goal for a design agent is the ability to learn generalizable design behavior in a problem space without having seen it before. We introduce a self-learning agent framework in this work that achieves this goal. This framework integrates a deep policy network with a novel tree search algorithm, where the tree search explores the problem space, and the deep policy network leverages self-generated experience to guide the search further. This framework first demonstrates an ability to discover high-performing generative strategies without any prior data, and second, it illustrates a zero-shot generalization of generative strategies across various unseen boundary conditions. This work evaluates the effectiveness and versatility of the framework by solving multiple versions of two engineering design problems without retraining. Overall, this paper presents a methodology to self-learn high-performing and generalizable problem-solving behavior in an arbitrary problem space, circumventing the need for expert data, existing solutions, and problem-specific learning.},

	abstract = {Important for many science and engineering fields, meaningful nonlinear models result from fitting such models to data by estimating the value of each parameter in the model. Since parameters in nonlinear models often characterize a substance or a system (e.g., mass diffusivity), it is critical to find the optimal parameter estimators that minimize or maximize a chosen objective function. In practice, iterative local methods (e.g., Levenberg–Marquardt method) and heuristic methods (e.g., genetic algorithms) are commonly employed for least squares parameter estimation in nonlinear models. However, practitioners are not able to know whether the parameter estimators derived through these methods are the optimal parameter estimators that correspond to the global minimum of the squared error of the fit. In this paper, a focused regions identification method is introduced for least squares parameter estimation in nonlinear models. Using expected fitting accuracy and derivatives of the squared error of the fit, this method rules out the regions in parameter space where the optimal parameter estimators cannot exist. Practitioners are guaranteed to find the optimal parameter estimators through an exhaustive search in the remaining regions (i.e., focused regions). The focused regions identification method is validated through two case studies in which a model based on Newton’s law of cooling and the Michaelis–Menten model are fitted to two experimental data sets, respectively. These case studies show that the focused regions identification method can find the optimal parameter estimators and the corresponding global minimum effectively and efficiently.},

However, designers often misjudge the AI’s and/or their own ability, leading to erroneous reliance on AI and therefore bad designs occur. To avoid such outcomes, it is crucial to understand the evolution of designers’ confidence in both their AI teammate(s) and themselves during AI-assisted decision-making. Therefore, this work conducts a cognitive study to explore how to experience various and changing (without notice) AI performance levels and feedback affects these confidences and consequently the decisions to accept or reject AI suggestions. The results first reveal that designers’ confidence in an AI agent changes with poor, but not with good, AI performance in this work. Interestingly, designers’ self-confidence initially remains unaffected by AI accuracy; however, when the accuracy changes, self-confidence decreases regardless of the direction of the change. Moreover, this work finds that designers tend to infer flawed information from feedback, resulting in inappropriate levels of confidence in both the AI and themselves. Confidence in AI and self-confidence are also shown to affect designers’ probability of accepting AI input in opposite directions in this study. Finally, results that are uniquely applicable to design are identified by comparing the findings from this work to those from a similar study conducted with a non-design task. Overall, this work offers valuable insights that may enable the detection of designers’ dynamic confidence and their consequent misuse of AI input in the design.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) enable researchers to create more powerful AI agents that are becoming competent teammates for humans. However, human distrust of AI is a critical factor that may impede human-AI cooperation. Although AI agents have been endowed with anthropomorphic traits, such as a human-like appearance, in prior studies to improve human trust in AI, it is still an open question whether humans have more trust in an AI teammate and achieve better human-AI joint performance if they are deceived about the identity of their AI teammate as another human. This research assesses the effects of teammate identity (“human” vs. AI) and teammate performance (low-performing vs. high-performing AI) on human-AI cooperation through a human subjects study. The results of this study show that humans behaviorally trust the AI more than another human by accepting their AI teammate's decisions more often. In addition, teammate performance has a significant effect on human-AI joint performance in the study, while teammate identity does not. These results caution against deceiving humans about the identity of AI in future applications involving human-AI cooperation.},

	abstract = {One degrees-of-freedom (1DOF) linkages are persistent in mechanical systems. However, designing linkages to follow a desired path, known as path synthesis, is challenging due to non-linearities, combinatorial nature, and strict geometric constraints. Current state-of-the-art algorithms cannot scale well to linkages with higher-order linkage graphs, which are required to satisfy more complicated paths for new mechanical systems, such as hopping and flying robots. One reason for this is that state-of-the-art algorithms spend the majority of the time exploring constraint-violating designs. This work uses an Assur group 0DOF linkage as a graph grammar rule to modify both linkage graph and spatial parameters, ensuring all designs are valid 1DOF linkages. Using this graph grammar, this paper formulates linkage path synthesis as a tree search and uses a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent to search the space of kinematically feasible planar 1DOF linkages. This paper introduces a method using a graph convolution policy for high-order linkage graph optimization (GCP-HOLO). An anytime algorithm, GCP-HOLO outputs linkages with 1–8 loops (4–16 bars) efficiently. When comparing the GCP-HOLO formulation to a recent state-of-the-art paper that solves a mixed integer conic program, GCP-HOLO generates sets of solutions of varying linkage complexities to eight test trajectories in a quarter of the time. Extending GCP-HOLO with a global node optimization, such as covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy, the results quickly converge to finding better solutions for 4/8 tests, with the whole pipeline capable of a 13X speed increase.},

	abstract = {Continuous constraint satisfaction is prevalent in many science and engineering fields. When solving continuous constraint satisfaction problems, it is more advantageous for practitioners to derive all feasible regions (i.e., the solution space) rather than a limited number of solution points, since these feasible regions facilitate design concept generation and design tradeoff evaluation. Several central processing unit (CPU)-based branch-and-prune methods and geometric approximation methods have been proposed in prior research to derive feasible regions for continuous constraint satisfaction problems. However, these methods have not been extensively adopted in practice, mainly because of their high computational expense. To overcome the computational bottleneck of extant CPU-based methods, this paper introduces a GPU-based parallel region classification method to derive feasible regions for continuous constraint satisfaction problems in a reasonable computational time. Using interval arithmetic, coupled with the computational power of GPU, this method iteratively partitions the design space into many subregions and classifies these subregions as feasible, infeasible, and indeterminate regions. To visualize these classified regions in the design space, a planar visualization approach that projects all classified regions into one figure is also proposed. The GPU-based parallel region classification method and the planar visualization approach are validated through two case studies about the bird function and the welded beam design. These case studies show that the method and the approach can solve the continuous constraint satisfaction problems and visualize the results effectively and efficiently. A four-step procedure for implementing the method and the approach in practice is also outlined.},

These behavior differences lead to significantly different performance levels, matching the human performance levels with just one exception. These validated heterogeneous agents are placed into teams and confirmed previous findings that the most proficient member of a configuration design team has the largest impact (positive or negative) on team performance.

	abstract = {Set-based concurrent engineering (SBCE), a process that develops sets of many design candidates for each subproblem throughout a design project, proposes several benefits compared to point-based processes, where only one design candidate for each subproblem is chosen for further development. These benefits include reduced rework, improved design quality, and retention of knowledge to use in future projects. Previous studies that introduce SBCE in practice achieved success and had very positive future outlooks, but SBCE encounters opposition because its core procedures appear wasteful as designers must divide their time among many designs throughout the process, most of which are ultimately not used. The impacts of these procedures can be explored in detail through open-source computational tools, but currently few exist to do this. This work introduces the Point/Set-Organized Research Teams (PSORT) modeling platform to simulate and analyze a set-based design process. The approach is used to verify statements made about SBCE and investigate its effects on project quality. Such an SBCE platform enables process exploration without needing to commit many projects and resources to any given design.},

	abstract = {Successful surgical operations are characterized by preplanning routines to be executed during actual surgical operations. To achieve this, surgeons rely on the experience acquired from the use of cadavers, enabling technologies like virtual reality (VR) and clinical years of practice. However, cadavers, having no dynamism and realism as they lack blood, can exhibit limited tissue degradation and shrinkage, while current VR systems do not provide amplified haptic feedback. This can impact surgical training increasing the likelihood of medical errors. This work proposes a novel Mixed Reality Combination System (MRCS) that pairs Augmented Reality (AR) technology and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor with 3D printed, collagen-based specimens that can enhance task performance like planning and execution. To achieve this, the MRCS charts out a path prior to a user task execution based on a visual, physical, and dynamic environment on the state of a target object by utilizing surgeon-created virtual imagery that, when projected onto a 3D printed biospecimen as AR, reacts visually to user input on its actual physical state. This allows a real-time user reaction of the MRCS by displaying new multi-sensory virtual states of an object prior to performing on the actual physical state of that same object enabling effective task planning. Tracked user actions using an integrated 9-Degree of Freedom IMU demonstrate task execution This demonstrates that a user, with limited knowledge of specific anatomy, can, under guidance, execute a preplanned task. In addition, to surgical planning, this system can be generally applied in areas such as construction, maintenance, and education.},

	abstract = {Teams are common throughout engineering practice and industry when solving complex, interdisciplinary problems. Previous works in engineering problem solving have studied the effectiveness of teams and individuals, showing that in some circumstances, individuals can outperform collaborative teams working on the same task. The current work extends these insights to novel team configurations in virtual, interdisciplinary teams. In these team configurations, the whole meta-team can interact, but the sub-teams within them may or may not. Here, team performance and process are studied within the context of a complex drone design and path-planning problem. Via a collaborative research platform called HyForm, communication and behavioral patterns can be tracked and analyzed throughout problem solving. This work shows that nominally inspired sub-structured teams, where members work independently, outperform interacting sub-structured teams. While problem-solving actions remain consistent, communication patterns significantly differ, with nominally inspired sub-structured teams communicating significantly less. Questionnaires reveal that the manager roles in the nominally inspired sub-structured teams, which are more central in communication and information flow, experience a greater cognitive and workload burden than their counterparts in the interacting sub-structured teams. Moreover, members in the nominally inspired sub-structured teams experience their teams as inferior on various dimensions, including communication and feedback effectiveness, yet their performance is superior. Overall, this work adds to the literature on nominal versus interacting problem-solving teams, extending the finding to larger, interdisciplinary teams.},

Human trust in AI is a crucial factor in ensuring an effective human–AI cooperation, and several approaches to enhance human trust in AI have been explored in prior studies. However, it remains an open question in engineering design whether human designers have more trust in an AI and achieve better joint performance when they are deceived into thinking they are working with another human designer.

Half of the participants are told that they work with an AI, and the other half of the participants are told that they work with another human participant but in fact they work with the AI design facilitator. The results demonstrate that, for this study, human designers adopt their facilitator’s design less often on average when they are deceived about the identity of the AI design facilitator as another human designer. However, design facilitator identity does not have a significant impact on human designers’ average performance, perceived workload, and perceived competency and helpfulness of their design facilitator in the study.

	abstract = {Purpose This study aims to gain a deeper understanding of the industry practice to guide the formation of support tools with a rigorous theoretical backing. Cross-functional teams are an essential component in new product development (NPD) of complex products to promote comprehensive coverage of product design, marketing, sales, support as well as many other activities of business. Efficient use of teams can allow for greater technical competency coverage, increased creativity, reduced development times and greater consideration of ideas from a variety of stakeholders. While academics continually aspire to propose methods for improved team composition, there exists a gap between research directions and applications found within industry practice. Design/methodology/approach Through interviewing product development managers working across a variety of industries, this paper investigates the common practices of team utilization in an organizational setting. Following these interviews, this paper proposes a conceptual two-dimensional management support model aggregating the primary drivers of team success and providing direction to systematically address features of team management and composition. Findings Based on this work, product managers are recommended to continually address the positioning of members throughout the entire NPD process. In the early stages, individuals are to be placed to work on project components with explicit consideration toward the perceived complexity of tasks and individual competency. Throughout the development process, individuals’ positions vary based on new information while continued emphasis is placed on maintaining a shared understanding. Originality/value Bridging the gap between theory and application within product development teams is a necessary step toward improved product develop. Industrial settings require practical solutions that can be applied economically and efficiently within their organization. Theoretical reflections postulated by academia support improved team design; however, to achieve true success, they must be applicable when considering product development.},

However, algorithmic style capture and reuse have not fully benefited from automated data-driven methodologies due to the challenging nature of design describability. This paper proposes an AI-driven method to fully automate the discovery of brand-related features. First, to tackle the scarcity of vectorized product images, this research proposes two data acquisition workflows: parametric modeling from small curve-based datasets, and vectorization from large pixel-based datasets. Second, this study constructs BIGNet, a two-tier Brand Identification Graph Neural Network, to learn from both scalar vector graphics’ curve-level and chunk-level parameters. In the first case study, BIGNet not only classifies phone brands but also captures brand-related features across multiple scales, such as lens’ location, as confirmed by AI evaluation. In the second study, this paper showcases the generalizability of BIGNet learning from a vectorized car image dataset and validates the consistency and robustness of its predictions given four scenarios. The results match the difference commonly observed in luxury versus economy brands in the automobile market. Finally, this paper also visualizes the activation maps generated from a convolutional neural network and shows BIGNet’s advantage of being a more explainable style-capturing agent.},
