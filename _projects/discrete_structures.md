OBJECTIVE 
The goal of this work is the development of a computational method and tool for structural design that enhances designer creativity and knowledge through the generation of languages of innovative structures that embody multiple design goals.

TECHNICAL APPROACH
shape annealing -a generative approach that combines a grammatical representation and design generation control through stochastic optimization using simulated annealing.

KEY FEATURES
lateral exploration of design concepts (not deterministic structural optimization)
languages of innovative designs for classes of structures consisting of multiple designs of similar quality with different styles
multi-objective optimization for structural design using the goals of efficiency, economy, elegance and function

APPLICATIONS
Planar trusses
geodesic like domes 

APPLICATIONS IN THE WORKS 
Tensegrity structures frames
