An artificial intelligence (AI) process manager agent is created to manage the design process of engineering teams in real-time, tracking features of teams’ actions and communications during a complex design and path-planning task with multidisciplinary team members, and making decisions on when to nudge the team to communicate or act differently. A study is run that compares AI-managed and human-managed teams. Across several dimensions, the overall results show that the AI manager agent at least matches the capabilities of the human managers, and even marginally performs better when the problem is changed for AI- and human-managed teams alike. Before and after analyses of the interventions indicate mixed adherence to the different types of interventions as induced in the intended process changes in the teams, and regression analyses show the impact of different interventions. Overall, this work lays the groundwork for a computational development and deployment of adaptive process management, with the goal to make engineering design as efficient as possible. showing potential in automating the management of a complex design process.

<!-- Teams are a major feature of engineering and are commonly thought to be necessary when solving dynamic and complex problems. Even though teams collectively provide a diversity of knowledge, skills, and perspectives to problem-solving, previous work has demonstrated that often the production by a team is inferior to that of a similar number of individuals working independently (i.e., nominal teams). By helping teams overcome potential deterrents that may be contributing to their inferior performance, this research explores the construct of adaptive feedback from a process manager, and how it can be computationally leveraged to lessen the underperformance of collaborative design teams.

A cognitive study was run with human designers, where they were given 30 minutes to solve an engineering design task. Three experimental conditions included: managed teams - composed of four freshman engineering students collectively solving the problem, with one mechanical engineering graduate student as a process manager overseeing their design process; unmanaged teams - comprised of five freshman engineering students and no graduate student manager; nominal teams - composed of five randomly chosen freshman engineering students who solved the problem individually but did not interact with each other. Instead, the best solution was chosen from amongst the five individual solutions. In the managed team condition, the managers were able to intervene with their design teams when they deemed appropriate, with a list of pre-defined stimuli in the manager bank. This bank included design keywords, design components, and designs strategies.


The managed teams significantly outperformed unmanaged teams in both the quality and novelty of their final designs. However, nominal teams (i.e., individuals) still marginally outperformed managed teams. This shows the beneficial effect of the process management, but still some deficiencies in team problem solving. Next the patterns of the process management were explored, by studying the times and timing of the process manager interventions over time. In general, the process managers’ interventions approach mimic a divergent to convergent search strategy. Early on in the beginning of the problem solving, managers intervened more with design strategies, which reminded the design teams of the engineering design requirements, constraints, goals, and other possible solutions that already exist. Then the interventions transitioned, toward the end of the experiment, to function design components, as the design teams iterated upon their design, and converged on a final design solution.


Are design teams truly better off working alone? This work supports the claim that they are, at least, in the domain of conceptual design. The empirical results from this work expand growing evidence that individuals are more effective than teams in a variety of problem-solving situations, including conceptual design. Ultimately, the hope is to understand why teams are not always maximally proficient, in what types of circumstances they significantly underperform, and what methods are most effective in assisting them. This study is a step towards uncovering approaches and methods that can build more focused and efficient engineering design teams, which have major implications for how design teams work together and solve problems in practice. -->
