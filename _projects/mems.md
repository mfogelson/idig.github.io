INTRODUCTION

This project spans several graduate student research projects. The idea is to create a system which designs topologies to MEMS problems such as accelerometers and gyroscopes independent of user interaction.

The approach used in accomplishing this ambitious conceptual design project is to combine the A-Design methodology with a specialized Hierarchical Evaluation Method.

Currently, the approach is being applied to the design of an accelerometer similar to Analog Devices ADXL series.
